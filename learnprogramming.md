# Escape from Tutorial Hell
- [Leave tutorial hell - here's how I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1e40e8g/leave_tutorial_hell_heres_how_i_did/)
- A common tutorial project is a to-do list. This is pretty simple. However, if you look at more sophisticated to-do lists (ones people use in real life), you can imagine how to make a more complicated to-do list.This might be easier than coming up with a completely different project. Instead, you enhance the project you followed a tutorial on.
