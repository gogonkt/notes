Pharley Simple system - Get your levels right for trading S/R

https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=592827

- [ ] Rules - Not too many really

Entry - 1 of 2 things:

1) Aggressive - After I've got my minor S/R drawn, and price breaks through the area, I place a limit order a couple of pips before that line.
2) Conservative - Wait for price to reach or pass the line, then close below it. Then I enter. (This requires more watching).

Sometimes you can set up an alert for when price reaches a level - good way to not watch the charts all the time.

SL - If I'm entering on 1) aggressive, my SL will be above/below the last swing. But as price (assuming!) moves in my favour I'll move it closer to BE and to BE + a couple of pips when I can. Use discretion here.

SL - If I'm entering on 2) conservative, my SL will go a few of pips above a candle that hit or crossed the line, but closed below it.

TP - 1) Aggressive - I'll target them all at the same place, which would be based on daily or weekly major S/R areas. Typically I'd target several pips in front of that. Actually I try and take 80% to 90% of a move between major S/R which can be found on daily/weekly charts.

TP 2) Conservative - I'd be targeting the next minor S/R level.

To be honest how you enter with this and exit and manage trades is really up to the individual. I'm just pointing out the potential trades as I see them on the charts. Here I put down how I go about entering this sort of trade and target - please feel free to use that or invent your own method.

I do manage the trade/s when I'm in - I'm always looking for multiple entries. But I don't enter a second trade until I can move SL to BE + 2 or 3 pips on the first trade. Same with the 3rd trade - I must be able to get trades 1 and 2 safe with a SL in front of entry. If I'm entering a 3rd trade, both exiting SL's from trades 1 and 2 move together to the same place to lock in profit.

But don't fall in to the trap of switching methods time and time again - choose a strategy or method you're happy with and stick with it. Master it, use it all the time before learning another. It could be just trading pin bars off the daily or 4hr chart, Or just 50% retraces. Or this one of mine or TS's great one. 

There are heaps, but do't get confused by switching between loads of them.

I'm just waiting for a retrace in a trend. Many times during a 1 hour candle you can see price start to retrace and it's tempting to enter during that hour. But a far better way is just to wait until that candle closes. (it's also less effort just looking at just once per hour or every 4 hours if trading 4hr charts).

If you wait until candles close, you can then start to see those S/R areas - I'm talking minor ones here - and draw a line at the appropriate area. 

Then you're waiting until price breaks and closes above/below it. As you're waiting for the candle to close, you do get a definite signal - it has close above or below the area. Then you can set your trade. 

In terms of direction - get the major S/R identified, then the trend. If I see higher highs and higher lows, it's trending up, the reverse is down. 

If there were a rule for this bit, it would be something like - there must be a trend and the trend is higher highs and higher lows for uptrend, and lower highs and lower lows for a downtrend.

If you look at the charts we've posted and other charts, you can see the best trades form this method are taken when this HH/HL or LH/LL is in place. 

The trick is to recognise that is happening (easier to see if you zoom out), and only take these trades during trending periods. 

Don't forget to look for rising or falling channels too - this works well inside of those. I really like channels!! Channels with this method of entry plus looking for pin bar set ups and 50% retracements is a good combination of things to look for. 

But keep it simple - identify one thing at a time before trying to look for others - it's just confusing at first. 
Yes I think it's a good simple way to look at things too.

R:R I never go less than 1:1. If I'm doing this 1 hr stuff, I prefer around 1:1.5 or 1:2

If I'm trading 4hr going towards weekly/daily S/R targets then it varies. That's because I'm entering multiple times, so the first trade might be targeting say 1:8 the second 1:7, etc.

How much do I risk - Typically I would keep risk at around 3% to 6% no matter how many trades I'm in. But it's tricky looking at risk as a %.
Say you've got $10,000 in your account and risk 5% = $500. But say you've got another $40,000 tucked away somewhere. That $500 risk now becomes 1% of your total funds. If that's the case, I'd be happy to up the $ risk I use in the account. 

I much prefer looking at risk as $ than % as I can live off $ but not %. If your account is say $2,000 you may feel comfortable risking $200. With a $50,000 account you might be ok with $2,000 risk. Different percentages all around. I just prefer to think about how much I'm risking in $

When I'm entering multiple times, I do try to get the first trade to BE + some pips as I enter the second and just keep doing that to reduce the risk until I'm risk free. That's a great position to be in!
Yes there are quite a few I wouldn't take - I attach a couple of pics below. The first one shows a 1hr G/Y chart.

On this you can see price closed above a S/R area then fell back down rapidly. Now why wouldn't have I take a long trade after it crossed over?

Look at the second pic, which is a daily chart showing the PA leading up to it. Price had recently fallen through a rising trend/support line and could possibly be on the way down again to the lower Support area. (In fact it did, but that's only known with hindsight).

Looking at the daily chart gives me an idea of when to avoid taking a long or short - I'm only interested in going with the flow and trend.

So what to do? Look for opportunities to short the pair, not go long. On the hour chart again, you can see price again crosses that line, then produces a wonderful (small) bear candle, closing both beneath the line and beneath the low of the bull candle that closed above the line. This is a good strong signal to enter short. The target area could be the daily chart low, or on the hourly chart, there is a swing low just to the left of the action - target just above that. It's amazing how many time price will return to the same swing point.

Look for multiple entries too, not just the one. I can several opportunities to short that pair at that point.

Oh I forgot - conservative vs aggressive. For me, the aggressive entry can be taken when everything is spot on. That means a trend in place on the daily, 4 hr and 1 hr chart, a clear consolidation area before a clean break through, then price if coming back to that break area with not too much momentum. If price is really hurrying to get back there, I'd wait to see what happens. If price is meandering it's way back, it shows a lack of commitment from traders to push the price in that direction again.

That's the sort of thing I'm looking at - hope it helps a bit.

Cheers

Don't forget to look at a higher timeframe to see what the potential TP could be - below are a 4hr chart with a possible TP (S/R) area shaded and another of the 1 hr chart with 3 possible trades.
